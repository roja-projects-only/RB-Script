# agent-skill-discovery

Scans installed resources and the current repository for plugins, agents, skills, and MCP servers.

## Overview

`agent-skill-discovery` is a platform-agnostic skill that provides a comprehensive inventory across two scopes: resources installed in the AI CLI environment and resources found in the current repository. It automatically detects whether you're using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or OpenAI Codex, and generates a structured catalog for both scopes.

## Features

- **🌐 Platform-Agnostic** - Works identically on all 8 AI CLI platforms
- **🔍 Comprehensive Discovery** - Finds plugins, agents, skills, and MCP servers
- **📁 Repository-Aware Scan** - Checks the current repository for local agents, skills, and MCP configs
- **📊 Structured Output** - Clean markdown catalog with resource counts
- **🔧 Zero-Config** - No setup required, discovers paths dynamically
- **🎯 Optional Filtering** - Filter by type, category, or keyword
- **⚡ Fresh Scans** - Always up-to-date, no stale cache

## When to Use

Use this skill when you want to:
- See what resources are installed on your system
- Discover new plugins or skills after installation
- Verify that a skill or plugin installed correctly
- Find MCP servers and their available tools
- Audit available capabilities before planning tasks
- Debug missing resources or tools
- Verify whether the current repository has local agents, skills, or MCP servers

## Installation

### Via NPM (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g claude-superskills
claude-superskills install agent-skill-discovery
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-superskills.git
cd claude-superskills

# Run build script to sync to all platforms
./scripts/build-skills.sh
```

## Usage

Simply ask your AI CLI to list your resources:

### Claude Code
```bash
claude
> "What do I have installed?"
> "List my MCP servers"
> "Show skills related to development"
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI
```bash
gh copilot
> "What do I have installed?"
> "Show available resources"
> "List only plugins"
```

### Gemini CLI / OpenCode / Codex
```bash
gemini  # or: opencode, codex
> "What do I have installed?"
> "Discover plugins"
```

## Example Output

```markdown
# 📦 Resource Discovery Report

**Platform:** Claude Code
**Scan Date:** 2026-02-07 14:32:15

## Filtering

### By Resource Type

```bash
> "List only plugins"
> "Show MCP servers"
> "Display my skills"
```

### By Category

```bash
> "Show development skills"
> "List content tools"
```

```

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Tested |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Claude Code | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| Gemini CLI | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| OpenCode | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| OpenAI Codex | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| Antigravity | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| Cursor IDE | ✅ Supported | Yes |
| AdaL CLI | ✅ Supported | Yes |

## How It Works

1. **Platform Detection** - Automatically identifies which AI CLI is running
2. **Installed Scan** - Finds installed plugin.json, SKILL.md, and MCP configs
3. **Repository Scan** - Scans current repository for local agents, skills, and MCP configs
4. **Data Parsing** - Extracts metadata from JSON/YAML frontmatter
5. **Catalog Generation** - Presents installed and repository scopes in structured markdown

## What Gets Discovered

### Plugins
- Plugin name and version
- Plugin description
- All agents within the plugin
- Tools available to each agent

### Skills
- Skill name and version
- Skill description
- Trigger phrases
- Category and tags

### MCP Servers
- Server name and type (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- Connection status
- Available tools with descriptions
- Command and arguments

### Current Repository
- Local agents declared in plugin manifests or agent folders
- Local skills defined by `skills/*/SKILL.md` conventions
- Local MCP servers declared in repository MCP config files

## Troubleshooting

### "No resources found"

**Possible causes:**
- Skills/plugins not installed yet
- Running in wrong directory
- Platform directories don't exist

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Install some skills first
claude-superskills install --all

# Verify platform directory exists
ls -la ~/.claude  # or ~/.github, ~/.gemini, etc.

# Run skill again
> "What do I have installed?"
```

### "MCP servers not discovered"

**Possible causes:**
- No .mcp.json file configured
- MCP servers not running
- Invalid JSON in .mcp.json

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if MCP config exists
cat ~/.claude/.mcp.json

# Validate JSON syntax
jq . ~/.claude/.mcp.json

# Restart MCP servers if needed
```

### "Platform detection failed"

**Possible causes:**
- Skill not installed in platform directory
- Multiple platforms installed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall skill
claude-superskills install agent-skill-discovery --force

# Check installation
ls ~/.claude/skills/agent-skill-discovery
ls ~/.copilot/skills/agent-skill-discovery
```
